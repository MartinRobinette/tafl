        <p>Welcome to tafl, you are playing as the attacker (red), click on a piece to see available moves</p>
        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <p>1. Brandub is played on a board of 7Ã—7 squares, with the central square and the corner squares marked.</p>
        <p>2. There are thirteen pieces: a king and his four defenders, and eight attackers. These are placed in the
            shape of a cross, as in the diagram.</p>
        <p>3. The attacking side takes the first move.</p>
        <p>4. Pieces move any distance orthogonally, not landing on nor jumping over other pieces on the board.</p>
        <p>5. No piece may land on the central square, not even the king once he has left it. Only the king may land on
            the corner squares.</p>
        <p>6. A piece other than the king is captured when it is surrounded orthogonally on two opposite squares by
            enemies. The king can take part in captures in partnership with a defender.</p>
        <p>7. A piece may also be captured between an enemy and the empty central square or a corner square.</p>
        <p>8. When in the central square, the king is captured by surrounding him on four orthogonal sides with
            attackers.</p>
        <p>9. When standing beside the central square, the king may be captured by surrounding him on the remaining
            three sides with attackers.</p>
        <p>10. Elsewhere on the board, the king is captured as other pieces.</p>
        <p>11. The king wins the game on reaching any of the marked corner squares. The attackers win if they capture
            the king.</p>
